AI-Powered Flight Agent
An all-in-one AI travel assistant that plans trips, books flights & hotels, teaches local languages, shows destination images, and ensures your safety all powered by multi-agent AI systems.

How This Idea Came

While planning a trip, I realized how fragmented the process is:

Flight booking on one website.

Hotel booking on another.

Language learning on a separate app.

Emergency contacts stored elsewhere.

I thought: What if one AI agent could do all of this seamlessly in one place?
That question became the Flight Agent

Why We Need This
Travel is not only about moving from point A to point B ‚Äî it‚Äôs about making the journey stress-free.
Currently:

Tools are disconnected.

There‚Äôs no emergency integration in trip planners.

Learning local phrases requires a separate app.

Flight Agent solves all of these by providing:
‚úîÔ∏è One AI interface for all tasks.

 About the Project
Flight Agent is an AI-powered multi-agent system that can:

Plan your trip ‚Äî suggest destinations & itineraries.

Provide detailed location info ‚Äî history, attractions, tips.

Teach local languages ‚Äî essential travel phrases.

Show destination images ‚Äî via Pixabay API.

Book flights ‚Äî using integrated APIs.

Book hotels ‚Äî find & reserve accommodations.

Inform relatives in case of emergency ‚Äî auto-email alerts via SMTP.
